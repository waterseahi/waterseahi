## PROJECTS 

#### Anomaly detection in multivariate time series series data via graph attenetion network

in this project model considers each univariate time-series as an individual feature and
includes two graph attention layers in parallel to learn the complex dependencies of
multivariate time-series in both temporal and feature dimensions. and jointly optimizes a
forecasting-based model and a reconstruction-based model, obtaining better time-series
reprensentations through a combination of single-timestamp prediction and
reconstruction of the entire time-series.
for this i used "https://github.com/ML4ITS/mtad-gat-pytorch"  ripo.
and changed the code in (preprocess.py,train.py and utils.py) to make it useable for my
custom dataset and 
fine tuned the model.

#### Convolution neural network model for rotten/fresh fruit detection
 Build and trained a Deep convolutional neural network using transfer learning concept
 for VGG-16 model pretrained on Imagenet to recognize fresh and rotten fruits dataset
 taken from kaggle.
used Tenserflow and keras library in this poject 
after fine tuning hyperparameters(learning rate,epoch) found accuracy 95% 

#### Text Denoising Autoencoder for News Headlines
Project includes building an autoencoder of news headlines. Build an encoder model that
maps a news headline to a vector embedding, and a decoder that reconstructs the news
headline. Both the encoder and decoder networks are Recurrent Neural Networks. 
and Training the autoencoder using data augmentation 
and Analyzing the embeddings (interpolating between headlines).
